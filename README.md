Task 4: Advanced Encryption Tool – DESCRIPTION

In today’s digital landscape, protecting sensitive files from unauthorized access is a top priority for individuals and organizations alike. 
Encryption is a fundamental technique in cybersecurity that transforms readable data into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users with the correct key or password can access the original information. 
This project focuses on building a robust AES-256 File Encryption/Decryption Tool using the Python programming language.
The primary goal of this tool is to provide a secure and user-friendly way to encrypt and decrypt files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key, which is widely regarded as one of the most secure symmetric encryption algorithms available. 
By encrypting files, users can ensure that even if their data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains protected and confidential.
This tool features a modern graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it accessible to users without command-line experience. 
The dashboard-style interface allows users to easily select files for encryption or decryption, enter a password (which is securely converted into a cryptographic key), and view status messages and logs of all actions performed. 
The tool also includes a console panel that displays a real-time log of operations, such as file selection, encryption, decryption, and output file creation.
The encryption process involves selecting a file, entering a password, and saving the encrypted output. 
The tool generates a secure random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation, ensuring that even identical files encrypted with the same password will produce different encrypted outputs. 
For decryption, the user selects the encrypted file, enters the same password, and specifies where to save the decrypted file. 
The tool verifies the password and restores the original file if the correct key is provided.
The implementation leverages the cryptography library for secure AES-256 encryption and decryption, and uses Python’s standard libraries for file handling and GUI operations. 
The tool also supports automatic screenshot capture of the application window after each encryption or decryption operation, providing a visual record of the tool’s output.
This AES-256 File Encryption/Decryption Tool is valuable in a variety of real-world scenarios:
Individuals can use it to protect personal documents, photos, and sensitive information.
Businesses can safeguard confidential files, financial records, and intellectual property.
IT professionals can ensure secure file transfer and storage within organizations.
The final deliverable is a Python application that allows users to:
Select files for encryption or decryption via a GUI.
Enter a password to generate a secure encryption key.
Encrypt or decrypt files with AES-256 security.
View status and log messages for all actions.
Automatically save a screenshot of the application window after each operation.
In conclusion, this project delivers a practical, secure, and easy-to-use tool for file encryption and decryption, helping users maintain the confidentiality and integrity of their data in an increasingly digital world.
